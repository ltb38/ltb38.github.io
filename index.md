## About Me

Hello! I am currently an Integrated MS/PhD student in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST. My advisor is professor Yongjung Kim. 

I am interested in nonlinear parabolic PDEs arising from material sciences, physics, and biology. Especially, I am interested in heterogeneous diffusion equations, reaction-diffusion equations, and solving PDEs using stochastic processes. I am recently studying heterogeneous random walk and mathematical modeling for diffusion related to permeability in biology.

## Research Interests

- **Heterogeneous Diffusion Equation:** Random Walk, Mathematical Modeling, Diffusion in Biology, Singular Limits
- **Stochastic Process and Parabolic PDEs:** Anomalous Diffusion, Brownian Motions
- **Reaction-Diffusion Equation**

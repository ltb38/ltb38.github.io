## About Me

Hello! I am currently an Integrated MS/PhD student in the Department of Mathematical Sciences, KAIST. My advisor is professor Yongjung Kim. 

I am interested in nonlinear parabolic PDEs arising from material sciences and biology. Especially, I am interested in heterogeneous diffusion equations and reaction-diffusion equations. I am recently studying heterogeneous random walk and mathematical modeling for diffusion in metals.

## Research Interests

- **Heterogeneous Diffusion Equation:** Random Walk, Mathematical Modeling, Diffusion in Metals, Singular Limits
- **Reaction-Diffusion Equation**
